# Computer vision tasks
## **Task 1**

  • Use MNIST dataset to build LeNet model

  • Add dropout 
  
  • Draw graphs for model accuracy and model loss 
  
  • Show how to reshape the dataset and one hot encode it

## **Task 2**

•Import CIFAR-10

•Standartise CIFAR-10

•Build CNN with 1 convolution

•Save network as json

•Draw metrics

Once the above tasks are done improve network

•Add more convolutions

Once the above tasks are done improve dataset

•Generate additional images

•Use augmentation methods

## **Task 3**
Using previously trained model and unseen examples predict the image class

## **Task 4**

•Use VGG imagenet

•Predict using unseen image from internet
